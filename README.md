# Stretch Reminder App

A desktop wellness app that uses your computerâ€™s webcam to detect when it's time to stretch after long periods of sitting. The app guides you through simple motion-based exercises (like arm raises, head rotations, and torso twists) and uses real-time pose detection to confirm proper movement.

Built with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe.
